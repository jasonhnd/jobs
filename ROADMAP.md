# ROADMAP

<!--
Template for loopcoder work units.

Fields:
- id: Stable short identifier used by depends_on.
- title: Short human-readable work unit title.
- scope: Brief description of what is included in the work unit.
- depends_on: List of work unit ids that must finish first; use [] when none.

## Done — occupation-first /me consolidation, acq-2…acq-6 (`preview`, 2026-08-20)

Shipped on `preview` / https://pre.mirai-shigoto.com. **Not** promoted to
`main`. Umbrella #233 stays open for #236 (SEO + GEO on existing pages; no
24 type pages). #234 stays open because it closes on a later entry number,
not on the ship.

- acq-2-funnel (#256 / #261): `shindan_start` + `shindan_step` (`value` 1..9).
- acq-3-screen2 (#257 / #262): 9 questions on `/me` behind `#meQuizOpen`.
- acq-4-screen3 (#258 / #263): occupation gap as `/me` screen 3; no `gap` in URL.
- acq-5-no-occ (#259 / #265): `/shindan` is `NO_OCC_PATH`; `/me/start` redirects there.
- acq-6-redirect (#260 / #265): humans `/shindan?job=` → `/me`; scrapers keep OG.
  Bare `/shindan` is **not** 301'd (owner lock 2026-08-17, supersedes the original table).
- Follow-ups: `/me` cream body (#266); desktop top nav 「自分の現在地」 (#267).
- JA copy in `docs/ME_CONSOLIDATION.md` §4.6 signed by owner 2026-08-20
  (`hidden_risk`: この仕事での進め方は、これから変えていけます).
- acq-7-share (#237): share text and worktype OG are measurement-led when a
  job is known (`{職業}のAI影響度は{点数}`). No-occupation shares stay identity.

## Done — v1.8.0 release reconciliation (#175, closed 2026-07-17)

### Production and release record

- Release preparation #198 set `package.json` to `1.8.0` and reconciled the
  complete post-v1.7 changelog. Owner decision #202 then permanently removed
  the feedback/newsletter forms, their APIs, Resend delivery, Turnstile, and
  form-only rate limiting in #205; none of those capabilities ships in v1.8.0.
- Reviewed promotion PR #206 advanced Production from the old
  `main@adc35960bfcedfe33c87dd532b6a9217c95813c1` baseline to the reconciled
  candidate at `main@b0a6432df9cb47b32f54ce76018d054dc98b8760` on 2026-07-17.
  Main CI run `29574329115` and Vercel deployment
  `dpl_7he94YGU8PyJWskChn1pakefCRcz` completed successfully.
- Production smoke covered `/`, `/models`, `/shindan`, `/gyakuten`, the active
  GPT-5.6 attribution, the `/404` versus `/occupations/404` route split, the
  form-free footer, and 404 responses for both retired API paths. The final
  documentation-only release record followed the same reviewed
  `preview` -> `main` path.
- The annotated `v1.8.0` tag and matching GitHub release identify the exact
  final `main` commit verified in Production. Issue #175 preserves the final
  `main` and `preview` SHAs, immutable deployment evidence, and smoke results.

### Shipped boundary

- v1.8.0 publishes the AI work-style diagnostic, the complete GPT-5.6 SOL
  556-occupation batch, multi-model comparison pages, ranking and diagnostic
  integrity fixes, performance work, and repository governance gates recorded
  in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- The experimental MBTI phase-1 route surface was reverted before release and
  is not shipped. Feedback submission, newsletter signup, Resend, Turnstile,
  and their dedicated infrastructure are also outside the product boundary.
- Post-production deletion of proven jobs-only external form configuration and
  historical records is tracked separately in #204 so release evidence remains
  distinct from account-level cleanup.

## Done — /models v2 design-debt rework (mms-4d, closed 2026-07-14)

- mms-4d-doc (#148): design for /models IA v3: hub + per-model pages.
- mms-4d-code-a (#149/#150): `/models/{slug}` per-model data pages.
- mms-4d-code-b (#151/#152): `/models` hub rework, roster/timeline,
  CJK line-break fixes, and detail-page score-history scaling.
- mms-4d-visual-fix (#153/#154): post-land visual cleanup for the hub and
  per-model page treatment.
- Umbrella tracker #121 closed as completed series hygiene.

## Done — GPT 5.6 SOL scoring (mms-5, closed 2026-07-13)

- mms-5-prep (#141/#142): frozen GPT prompt `data/prompts/2026-07-12_gpt-5.6-sol-aiois10.ja.md` + runbook Codex section.
- mms-5-exec-pilot (#126): 40-occ pilot, drift +0.48T, owner-approved.
- mms-5-exec-full (#126/#146): full 556 (+0.72T vs Fable 5, monotonic), landed canonical.
- Along the way fixed `assemble-scores.ts` hardcoded `model_provider:'anthropic'`
  → added `--provider` + `inferProvider()` (gpt→openai). 5 canonical-flip fixture
  tests updated (score-history 3→4 batches, models-deep latest pair, worktypes
  pinned %, ai-fact-summary attribution).
